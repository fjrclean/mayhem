##Gameplay

Mayhem is a multiplayer (2 - 4) flight shooter with a really simple objective - destroy your opponents before they destroy you.

Your ship has limited fuel which will run down when you boost, if you run out you will be unable to control your ship, to refuel, land on any flat surface.

You can protect yourself from attack using your shields which will stop all bullets, be careful though your shields run down quickly and you wont be able to boost while your shields are on. 

Powerups are dropped (sometimes) when a player is destroyed (by either crashing or being shot) and when collected will give you a temporary boost.

###Options

Levels 1-3 are the original game levels, all other levels are new to Mayhem 2.

DCA are anti spaceship guns which will fire at the player if they get too close.

Wall collision can be turned off for new players to get used to the controls and playing the game.
